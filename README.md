## Assignment: Log Analysis Script

### **Objective**

The goal of this assignment is to assess your ability to write a Python script that processes log files to extract and analyze key information. This assignment evaluates your proficiency in **file handling**, **string manipulation**, and **data analysis**, which are essential skills for cybersecurity-related programming tasks.

### **Core Requirements**

Your Python script should implement the following functionalities:

1. **Count Requests per IP Address**:
    - Parse the provided log file to extract all IP addresses.
    - Calculate the number of requests made by each IP address.
    - Sort and display the results in descending order of request counts.
    - Example output:
  
  IP Address           Request Count
192.168.1.1          234
203.0.113.5          187
10.0.0.2             92

2. **Identify the Most Frequently Accessed Endpoint**:
    - Extract the endpoints (e.g., URLs or resource paths) from the log file.
    - Identify the endpoint accessed the highest number of times.
    - Provide the endpoint name and its access count.
    - Example output:
  
   Most Frequently Accessed Endpoint:
/home (Accessed 403 times)

3. **Detect Suspicious Activity**:
    - Identify potential brute force login attempts by:
        - Searching for log entries with failed login attempts (e.g., HTTP status code `401` or a specific failure message like "Invalid credentials").
        - Flagging IP addresses with failed login attempts exceeding a configurable threshold (default: 10 attempts).
    - Display the flagged IP addresses and their failed login counts.
    - Example output:

Suspicious Activity Detected:
IP Address           Failed Login Attempts
192.168.1.100        56
203.0.113.34         12

4. **Output Results**:
    - Display the results in a clear, organized format in the terminal.
    - Save the results to a CSV file named `log_analysis_results.csv` with the following structure:
        - **Requests per IP**: Columns: `IP Address`, `Request Count`
        - **Most Accessed Endpoint**: Columns: `Endpoint`, `Access Count`
        - **Suspicious Activity**: Columns: `IP Address`, `Failed Login Count`
     
  ### **Sample Log File**

Here is a sample log file you will use for this assignment. Save it as `sample.log`:



### **Evaluation Criteria**

1. **Functionality**
    - The script processes the provided log file correctly and fulfills all requirements.
    - All sections of the analysis are implemented: IP request counts, most accessed endpoint, and suspicious activity detection.
2. **Code Quality**
    - Clear, well-organized, and modular code.
    - Proper use of comments, meaningful variable names, and adherence to Python best practices.
3. **Performance**
    - The script handles the provided log file efficiently and can scale to larger files without significant delays.
4. **Output**
    - Correctly formatted output in both the terminal and the saved CSV file.
    - The CSV file structure matches the specified format.
